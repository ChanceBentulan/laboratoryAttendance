# laboratoryAttendance

This is a school project we made back then together with my schoolmates.

It's a web application for school laboratories to be specific. Working students can log in and log out while teachers can monitor whether the students are tardy or on time.

The backend is composed of vanila PHP no framework used. While the frontend we used mostly HTML and a bit of CSS.
